## Rebooting the Web of Trust V: Boston (October 2017)

This repository contains documents related to RWOT5, the fifth Rebooting the Web of Trust design workshop, which is to run in Boston, Masachusetts, on October 3rd-5th, 2017. The goal of the workshop was to generate five technical white papers and/or proposals on topics decided by the group that would have the greatest impact on the future.

##  Topics & Advance Readings

In advance of the design workshop, all participants produced a one-or-two page topic paper to be shared with the other attendees on either:

* A specific problem that they wanted to solve with a web-of-trust solution, and why current solutions (PGP or CA-based PKI) can't address the problem?
* A specific solution related to the web-of-trust that you'd like others to use or contribute to?
